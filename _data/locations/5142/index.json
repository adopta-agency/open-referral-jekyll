Our organization currently serves approximately 275 children annually through our three child development centers: NCEF Early Childhood Development Center, and A Step Up Child Development Centers located at Golden Gate and Immokalee High Schools operated through CCCR. \\n\\nAt NCEF Early Childhood Development Center, 75 percent of the children who attend are from low-income, working families and receive partial financial assistance through CCCR. Of the children enrolled 60 percent live at or below the Federal Poverty Line. \\n\\nA Step Up Child Development Centers focus on children of teen mothers by offering free valuable child care and parenting classes while they continue their high school education; this allows for a better future for them and their child, without worry of needing to pay for childcare. \\n\\nWe also offer training symposiums for early learning professionals and on site training.",
