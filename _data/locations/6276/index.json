Our goal is to increase children's access to books and to increase parents and caregivers knowledge of both the importance of early literacy and the shared reading experience by placing 40 bookshelves full of free books throughout Miami-Dade County where they visit together often, including clinics and doctors' offices, the Juvenile Justice Center, and Community Service Centers. Each bookshelf is located within an accessible area that is identified as an Education Transformation Zone by Miami Dade County Public schools.",
