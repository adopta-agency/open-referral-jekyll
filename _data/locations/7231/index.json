By facilitating exposure to the natural world (through organic gardening, culinary, marine and weather studies, local cultural life, and other elements), by learning travel training and web\/videography skills, and by enhancing social skills, our population can help become important local story tellers and programmers, empowering them as model stewards in sensitizing the broader population to simpler, healthier forms of community wellness.\\n\\nUrban Explorers:\\nHeld at the Frost Museum of Science where students learn about the culture, history and environment of Miami.
