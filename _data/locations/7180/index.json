		"description": "Established in 1978, the Collier County Museums offer a rich sampling of the people, places and events that make this area's history and heritage well worth exploring.\r\n\r\nWe offer five separate and unique museum facilities, each providing a different glimpse into our past, where a diverse blend of old and new, history and legend, weaves its story across a glittering landscape of sun-warmed beaches, ancient cypress forests, and the sprawling grasslands of the Florida Everglades. Discover fierce saber cats and long-vanished civilizations, stunning archaeological finds and curious inventions, turn-of-the-century trading posts, cowmen, cattle ranches, and some of Florida's most adventurous and colorful characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n###COL###",
