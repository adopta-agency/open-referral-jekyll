There are times when those; especially in the service, entertainment and sales business; need some extra help to get over a 'bad time'. This non-profit has been formed to attempt to raise money for those tough times.\n\nThe fund assists with rent short falls and basic utility bills while recuperating from their illness or personal disaster, but will also attempt to help with uncovered medical expenses.",
