  description: FRSMiami provides a drug and alcohol intensive outpatient program for
    adolescents and adults who are struggling with substance abuse and addiction.
    Treatment is individualized and tailored to the person based on a thorough evaluation
    and mutually agreed upon goals. Our program consists of education, individual
    counseling, group therapy, family therapy and random drug screening for all participants.
    We provide highly individualized and comprehensive services for addiction and
    recovery and utilize best practices to serve all our clients and families.\n\nThis
    program includes education about the physical, emotional and social risks associated
    with substance use. Clients are taught refusal skills and other coping mechanisms
    in order to make better choices related to living a physically and emotionally
    healthy lifestyle free from substance use. Families are educated about substance
    abuse and the addictive disease process and taught how to best support their loved
    one in recovery. Patients and their families attend a weekly multi-family group
    counseling session where issues of communication, conflict resolution and recovery
    are processed. Families are provided direction and supported in order to learn
    new, more effective ways of communicating and relating to one another.\n\nEach
    patient undergoes a thorough bio-psycho-social assessment and specific substance
    abuse evaluation with a licensed professional counselor and addiction specialist.
    In our outpatient rehab we assess the level of substance involvement and examine
    all consequences related to use. In addition, we explore the family situation
    to determine what other support may be necessary for recovery. Other co-occurring
    mental health issues are also examined and a referral to a consulting psychologist/psychiatrist
    is made when necessary.\n\nOur outpatient program meets four times per week. Individual
    and family therapy appointments are scheduled at a time that is convenient for
    the client and family.

  description: FRSMiami provides a drug and alcohol intensive outpatient program for
    adolescents and adults who are struggling with substance abuse and addiction.
    Treatment is individualized and tailored to the person based on a thorough evaluation
    and mutually agreed upon goals. Our program consists of education, individual
    counseling, group therapy, family therapy and random drug screening for all participants.
    We provide highly individualized and comprehensive services for addiction and
    recovery and utilize best practices to serve all our clients and families.\n\nThis
    program includes education about the physical, emotional and social risks associated
    with substance use. Clients are taught refusal skills and other coping mechanisms
    in order to make better choices related to living a physically and emotionally
    healthy lifestyle free from substance use. Families are educated about substance
    abuse and the addictive disease process and taught how to best support their loved
    one in recovery. Patients and their families attend a weekly multi-family group
    counseling session where issues of communication, conflict resolution and recovery
    are processed. Families are provided direction and supported in order to learn
    new, more effective ways of communicating and relating to one another.\n\nEach
    patient undergoes a thorough bio-psycho-social assessment and specific substance
    abuse evaluation with a licensed professional counselor and addiction specialist.
    In our outpatient rehab we assess the level of substance involvement and examine
    all consequences related to use. In addition, we explore the family situation
    to determine what other support may be necessary for recovery. Other co-occurring
    mental health issues are also examined and a referral to a consulting psychologist/psychiatrist
    is made when necessary.\n\nOur outpatient program meets four times per week. Individual
    and family therapy appointments are scheduled at a time that is convenient for
    the client and family.

  description: FRSMiami provides a drug and alcohol intensive outpatient program for
    adolescents and adults who are struggling with substance abuse and addiction.
    Treatment is individualized and tailored to the person based on a thorough evaluation
    and mutually agreed upon goals. Our program consists of education, individual
    counseling, group therapy, family therapy and random drug screening for all participants.
    We provide highly individualized and comprehensive services for addiction and
    recovery and utilize best practices to serve all our clients and families.\n\nThis
    program includes education about the physical, emotional and social risks associated
    with substance use. Clients are taught refusal skills and other coping mechanisms
    in order to make better choices related to living a physically and emotionally
    healthy lifestyle free from substance use. Families are educated about substance
    abuse and the addictive disease process and taught how to best support their loved
    one in recovery. Patients and their families attend a weekly multi-family group
    counseling session where issues of communication, conflict resolution and recovery
    are processed. Families are provided direction and supported in order to learn
    new, more effective ways of communicating and relating to one another.\n\nEach
    patient undergoes a thorough bio-psycho-social assessment and specific substance
    abuse evaluation with a licensed professional counselor and addiction specialist.
    In our outpatient rehab we assess the level of substance involvement and examine
    all consequences related to use. In addition, we explore the family situation
    to determine what other support may be necessary for recovery. Other co-occurring
    mental health issues are also examined and a referral to a consulting psychologist/psychiatrist
    is made when necessary.\n\nOur outpatient program meets four times per week. Individual
    and family therapy appointments are scheduled at a time that is convenient for
    the client and family.

    of private and public agencies, health care and disability rights advocates, professionals,
    educators, transportation organizations, housing and service providers, individuals
    with disabilities and their families and friends. The Coalition was formed in
    2014 to evaluate services currently available through organizations in our region
    and to discuss present and future needs for those with disabilities. Our coalition
    aims to:\n\nPromote and develop choices for people with disabilities and to ensure
    that they have the broadest range of options for education, health services, housing
    and lifespan needs.\n\nEducate coalition members and the community at large on
    innovative alternatives and approaches through monthly meetings, site visits and
    speakers.\n\nEnhance communication between organizations and agencies in our region
    to connect the dots between existing services with both present and future needs.\n\nCreate
    an ongoing resource for all those who serve the special needs population by offering
    a forum to collectively road map a plan to serve individuals on a variety of fronts
    from birth through mature adulthood.\n\nProvide a pathway for new and existing
    providers to reach out to those undeserved in our community, and to pinpoint areas
    that require critical attention.\n\n###COL###

  description: 'MFCC is a unique counseling center that provides therapy that supports
    parents and caretakers with family members that are chronically ill. The goal
    of MFCC is to strive to help parents and caretakers cope with profoundly disheartening
    news about your child''s or loved one''s health due to a medical diagnosis along
    with case management. MFCC knows that a medical diagnosis can be a life altering
    event that places parents/ caretakers under daily stressors that most could not
    understand.\r\n\r\nThis often creates feelings and expectations that one needs
    to be a perfect parent/caretaker in an imperfect situation with little support.
    MFCC knows this is a difficult feeling to manage alone and this is why we strive
    to aid parents with counseling that encourages new adaptive coping techniques.
    Accepts some insurances.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: Currently not taking any new patients
    because of office remodeling/office is currently closed along with the mailing

    local cultural life, and other elements), by learning travel training and web/videography
    skills, and by enhancing social skills, our population can help become important

  description: Read to Learn Books for Free aims to increase literacy opportunities
    for all children residing in Miami-Dade County. Our goal is to increase children's
    access to books and to increase parents and caregivers knowledge of both the importance
    of early literacy and the shared reading experience by placing 40 bookshelves
    full of free books throughout Miami-Dade County where they visit together often,
    including clinics and doctors' offices, the Juvenile Justice Center, and Community
    Service Centers. Each bookshelf is located within an accessible area that is identified
    as an Education Transformation Zone by Miami Dade County Public schools.

    NCEF Early Childhood Development Center, 75 percent of the children who attend
    are from low-income, working families and receive partial financial assistance
    through CCCR. Of the children enrolled 60 percent live at or below the Federal
    Poverty Line. \n\nA Step Up Child Development Centers focus on children of teen
    mothers by offering free valuable child care and parenting classes while they
    continue their high school education; this allows for a better future for them
    and their child, without worry of needing to pay for childcare. \n\nWe also offer

  description: "Fanm Ayisyen Nan Miyami, Inc. is an award-winning 501(c)(3)comprehensive
    social service and advocacy agency serving the Haitian residents of Greater Miami.
    Our Current Core Programs include:\\r\\n\\r\\nFamily Intervention and Empowerment
    (FIEP):\\r\\nThe Family Intervention and Empowerment program focuses on transitional
    and cultural adjustment needs of Haitian families. Services include case management,
    psycho-social assessment, development of a treatment plan, crisis intervention,
    mental health counseling, domestic violence support and anger management groups
    and parenting and early childhood parenting classes. Three additional support
    programs focus on outreach, prevention, education and referral: 1) Health Access
    for the uninsured or under-insured; 2) Breast Health, which seeks to prevent breast
    cancer through outreach, education, dissemination of information, cancer screenings
    and follow up; and 3) After School Tutoring, which provides homework help, FCAT
    preparation, and identity and character building through self-expression and sports.
    In response to a great and growing need in our community, last summer FANM created
    a Legal Services Clinic, that provides legal assistance and referrals to clients
    in the Haitian community in the areas of immigration law, family law including
    guardianship and domestic violence, public benefits law and landlord/tenant and
    housing law. The Clinic also conducts -\xF4know your rights-\xF6 educational sessions
    as well as self-help divorce and landlord/tenant clinics. \\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration
    Advocacy and Citizenship:\\r\\nThe Immigration Advocacy and Citizenship program
    focuses on public policy issues surrounding Haitian detainees, entrants, refugees
    and asylees. It works to meet with the media, elected officials, INS staff and
    other ethnic groups and organizations concerned with the unfair treatment of Haitian
    entrants into the United States. It conducts forums to educate the community at
    large about the current state of immigration, assists individuals with completing
    INS forms, and holds workshops and presentations on immigration matters and citizenship
    procedures. It also has established citizenship classes with an English literacy
    component for Haitian Creole speakers. \\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity Economic Development
    (CED):\\r\\nThe Community Economic Development program creates income and benefits
    opportunities for the unemployed or underemployed. Individuals are trained in
    business operation skills (inventory, marketing, customer service, sales, money
    management, etc.). The CED program also advocates for a living wage, and assists
    neighborhood businesses with fa+\xBAade renovation, code compliance and job creation
    matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever funding is available, FANM implements culturally
    and linguistically sensitive outreach and education programs that focus on cancer
    and HIV/AIDS and prevention. FANM developed the first HIV/AIDS educational tool
    - a videotape on AIDS Prevention with subtitles that is used by the Florida Department
    of Children and Families and the Haitian media in the USA and Haiti. FANM is also
    finalizing a Haitian Creole copy of the Susan G. Komen Breast Health Basics video."

  description: Foster Care Review (FCR) is a non-profit organization that monitors
    the cases of abused, neglected and abandoned children placed in foster care. In
    an overburdened system, FCR ensures that children and youth living in our community's
    foster care system have adults who will look out for their best interests and
    needs such as healthcare, stable schooling and safe, permanent homes.\n\nTo accomplish
    this, we rely on our greatest strength - concerned citizens. Volunteers serve
    one weekday per month on citizen review panels to conduct case review hearings
    to monitor the wellbeing of each child. Recommendations are submitted to the court
    for services the child needs and actions that should be taken to ensure the child's
    safety, wellbeing and progress towards finding a permanent home. With each panel's
    recommendations, a juvenile court judge gains the insight of five committed adults
    who have heard the facts, considered the options and serve as advocates for each
    child.

  description: When kids are hurting, we help them heal. When kids need a safe place
    to call "home," we find them loving families. When parents want to provide stable,
    nurturing homes for their babies, we help. When families are in crisis, we help
    them rebuild trust. Create stronger bonds. We create brighter futures for kids,
    for families, for communities. Kids need us. They need you. Together, we'll make
    an even bigger difference.\n###COL###
