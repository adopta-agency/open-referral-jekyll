Present your card with each prescription to the pharmacy at the time of purchase to receive your discount. Savings average 40% but can be as high as 75% on some generics. The card is really just like a reusable prescription coupon on all FDA approved medicines.\r\n\r\nNo eligibility or registration is required.\r\n\r\n###MON###\r\n###COL###",
