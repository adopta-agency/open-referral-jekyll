	"description": "The Florida Keys Healthy Start Coalition is a 501(c)3 community based organization. We are a prenatal and infant care Coalition of private and public agencies, community-centered providers, local businesses and passionate individuals in Monroe County. It is the intent of the Healthy Start legislation to establish a system that guarantees that all women in Monroe County have access to prenatal care and that all infants have access to services that promote normal growth and development. Healthy Start services are provided free of charge and include but are not limited to: stress-management; home-visiting, parenting skills, nutritional information, baby-spacing information, breastfeeding and childbirth education, and assistance with accessing financial assistance for pregnancy costs and infant care costs. We work with women and families of all economic levels, with or without insurance. \n\n###MON###",
